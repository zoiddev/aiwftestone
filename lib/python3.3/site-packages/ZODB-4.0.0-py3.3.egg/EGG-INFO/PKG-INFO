Description: The Zope Object Database provides an object-oriented database for
        Python that provides a high-degree of transparency. Applications can
        take advantage of object database features with few, if any, changes
        to application logic.  ZODB includes features such as a plugable storage
        interface, rich transaction support, and undo.

        Introduction
        ============
        
        The ZODB  package provides a  set of tools  for using the  Zope Object
        Database (ZODB).
        
        Our primary development platforms are Linux and Mac OS X.  The test
        suite should pass without error on these platforms and, hopefully,
        Windows, although it can take a long time on Windows -- longer if you
        use ZoneAlarm.
        
        Compatibility
        =============
        
        ZODB 4.0 requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3.
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        You must have Python installed. If you're using a system Python
        install, make sure development support is installed too.
        
        You also need the transaction, BTrees, persistent, zc.lockfile,
        ZConfig, zdaemon, zope.event, zope.interface, zope.proxy and
        zope.testing packages.  If you don't have them and you can connect to
        the Python Package Index, then these will be installed for you if you
        don't have them.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ZODB is released as a distutils package.  The easiest ways to build
        and install it are to use `easy_install
        <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_, or
        `zc.buildout <http://www.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_.
        
        To install by hand, first install the dependencies, ZConfig, zdaemon,
        zope.interface, zope.proxy and zope.testing.  These can be found
        in the `Python Package Index <http://www.python.org/pypi>`_.
        
        To run the tests, use the test setup command::
        
          python setup.py test
        
        It will download dependencies if needed.  If this happens, ou may get
        an import error when the test command gets to looking for tests.  Try
        running the test command a second time and you should see the tests
        run.
        
        ::
        
          python setup.py test
        
        To install, use the install command::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        
        Testing for Developers
        ======================
        
        The ZODB checkouts are `buildouts <http://www.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_.
        When working from a ZODB checkout, first run the bootstrap.py script
        to initialize the buildout:
        
            % python bootstrap.py
        
        and then use the buildout script to build ZODB and gather the dependencies:
        
            % bin/buildout
        
        This creates a test script:
        
            % bin/test -v
        
        This command will run all the tests, printing a single dot for each
        test.  When it finishes, it will print a test summary.  The exact
        number of tests can vary depending on platform and available
        third-party libraries.::
        
            Ran 1182 tests in 241.269s
        
            OK
        
        The test script has many more options.  Use the ``-h`` or ``--help``
        options to see a file list of options.  The default test suite omits
        several tests that depend on third-party software or that take a long
        time to run.  To run all the available tests use the ``--all`` option.
        Running all the tests takes much longer.::
        
            Ran 1561 tests in 1461.557s
        
            OK
        
        
        Maintenance scripts
        -------------------
        
        Several scripts are provided with the ZODB and can help for analyzing,
        debugging, checking for consistency, summarizing content, reporting space used
        by objects, doing backups, artificial load testing, etc.
        Look at the ZODB/script directory for more informations.

        ================
         Change History
        ================
        
        4.0.0 (2013-08-18)
        ==================
        
        Finally released.
        
        4.0.0b3 (2013-06-11)
        ====================
        
        - Switch to using non-backward-compatible pickles (protocol 3, without
          storing bytes as strings) under Python 3.  Updated the magic number
          for file-storage files under Python3 to indicate the incompatibility.
        
        - Fixed: A ``UnicodeDecodeError`` could happen for non-ASCII OIDs
          when using bushy blob layout.
        
        4.0.0b2 (2013-05-14)
        ====================
        
        - Extended the filename renormalizer used for blob doctests to support
          the filenames used by ZEO in non-shared mode.
        
        - Added ``url`` parameter to ``setup()`` (PyPI says it is required).
        
        4.0.0b1 (2013-05-10)
        =====================
        
        - Skipped non-unit tests in ``setup.py test``.  Use the buildout to run tests
          requiring "layer" support.
        
        - Included the filename in the exception message to support debugging in case
          ``loadBlob`` does not find the file.
        
        - Added support for Python 3.2 / 3.3.
        
        .. note::
        
           ZODB 4.0.x is supported on Python 3.x for *new* applications only.
           Due to changes in the standard library's pickle support, the Python3
           support does **not** provide forward- or backward-compatibility
           at the data level with Python2.  A future version of ZODB may add
           such support.
        
           Applications which need migrate data from Python2 to Python3 should
           plan to script this migration using separte databases, e.g. via a
           "dump-and-reload" approach, or by providing explicit fix-ups of the
           pickled values as transactions are copied between storages.
        
        
        4.0.0a4 (2012-12-17)
        =====================
        
        - Enforced usage of bytes for ``_p_serial`` of persistent objects (fixes
          compatibility with recent persistent releases).
        
        4.0.0a3 (2012-12-01)
        =====================
        
        - Fixed: An elaborate test for trvial logic corrupted module state in a
                way that made other tests fail spuriously.
        
        4.0.0a2 (2012-11-13)
        =====================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - An unneeded left-over setting in setup.py caused installation with
          pip to fail.
        
        4.0.0a1 (2012-11-07)
        =====================
        
        New Features
        ------------
        
        - The ``persistent`` and ``BTrees`` packages are now released as separate
          distributions, on which ZODB now depends.
        
        - ZODB no longer depends on zope.event.  It now uses ZODB.event, which
          uses zope.event if it is installed.  You can override
          ZODB.event.notify to provide your own event handling, although
          zope.event is recommended.
        
        - BTrees allowed object keys with insane comparison. (Comparison
          inherited from object, which compares based on in-process address.)
          Now BTrees raise TypeError if an attempt is made to save a key with
          comparison inherited from object. (This doesn't apply to old-style
          class instances.)
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - Ensured that the export file and index file created by ``repozo`` share
          the same timestamp.
        
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/993350
        
        - Pinned the ``transaction`` and ``manuel`` dependencies to Python 2.5-
          compatible versions when installing under Python 2.5.
        
        
        .. note::
           Please see ``doc/HISTORY.txt`` for changelog entries for older versions
           of ZODB.
